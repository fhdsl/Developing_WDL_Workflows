# The first task



## Runtime attributes
The runtime attributes of a task tell the WDL executor important information about how to run the task. These attributes are often specific to particular backends, so we won't go over all of them here, but here are some of the most common ones:

## Command section 
The command section of a WDL task is a bash script that will be run by the WDL executor. If a `docker` runtime attribute is specified, it will execute this bash script in that Docker image, otherwise, it will generally execute the bash script in a generic Ubuntu image.

### Heredoc-style syntax versus braces syntax
You may see WDLs that use this notation for the command section in a task:

```
task do_something {
  input {
    String some_string
  }
  command {
    some_other_string="FOO"
    echo ${some_string}
    echo $some_other_string
  }
}
```

We recommend using heredoc-style syntax instead:
```
task do_something {
  input {
    String some_string
  }
  command <<<
    some_other_string="FOO"
    echo ~{some_string}
    echo $some_other_string
  >>>
}
```

Heredoc-style syntax for command sections can be clearer than the alternative, as it makes a clearer distinction between bash variables and WDL variables. This is especially helpful for complicated bash scripts. Heredoc-style syntax is also what the WDL 1.1 spec recommends using in most cases. However, the older non-heredoc style is still perfectly functional for a lot of use cases.

### Referencing variables
Assuming heredoc syntax is being used, a WDL task's input variables are generally referred to in the command section using a tilde (~) and curly braces. To prevent issues with spaces in strings, it is often a good idea to put quotation marks around a string variable, like so:

<!-- TODO: make sure unix cowsay acts like this too, not just the python wrapper I use -->

```
task cowsay {
  input {
    String some_string
  }
  command <<<
    cowsay -t "~{some_string}"
  >>>
}
```
If we had written `cowsay -t ~{some_string}` and `some_string` was `foo bar`, then the script would be intepreted as `cowsay -t foo bar` and cause an error, because the cowsay program thinks `bar` is an argument. By including quotation marks, `cowsay -t "~{some_string}"` can be interpreted as `cowsay -t "foo bar"` and you will correctly get a cow saying "foo bar" instead of an error.

If the input variable is an array, we must include an array seperator. In WDL 1.0, this is done using the `sep=` expression placeholder:

<!-- TODO: array seperator -->

::: {.notice data-latex="warning"}
The WDL 1.1 spec added a new built-in function, `sep()`, which replaces the `sep=` expression placeholder for arrays. This same version of the spec also notes that the `sep=` expression placeholder [are deprecated and will be removed from future versions of WDL](https://github.com/openwdl/wdl/blob/main/versions/1.1/SPEC.md#-expression-placeholder-options). For the time being, we recommend sticking with `sep=` as it is compatiable with both WDL 1.0 and WDL 1.1, even though it is technically deprecated in WDL 1.1.

## Outputs

Outputs can (generally, see warning below) also be functions of other outputs in the same task, as long as those outputs are declared first.

::: {.notice data-latex="warning"}
Cromwell does not fully support outputs being a function of the same task's other outputs. On the Terra backend, the above code example would cause an error.

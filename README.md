## About this course

"Developing WDL Workflows" shows a bioinformatics workflow developer how to strategically develop and scale up a WDL workflow that is iterative, reproducible, and efficient in terms of time and resource used. This guide is flexible regardless of where the data is, what computing resources are being used, and what software is being used. 

## Learning Objectives

This course will teach learners to: how to write an effective WDL task, link multiple WDL tasks together in a workflow, organize variables via structs, scale multiple samples via Arrays, reuse repeated tasks via task aliasing, and configure settings for the execution engine.
